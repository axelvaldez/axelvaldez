# 👋 Hi, I’m @axelvaldez

[I have a personal website](https://axelvaldez.mx), and [a blog about HTML and CSS](https://htmlycss.com). On social, [I'm on Instagram](https://instagram.com/axelvaldez).

I’m very interested in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, blogs, the open web and podcasting. When AFK I hang out with my kids, bake bread and cook yummy things.

Say hi! You can reach me at axel-at-paskola.com.
