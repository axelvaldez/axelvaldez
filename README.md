# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @axelvaldez

[I have a website](https://axelvaldez.mx), [A newsletter](https://theheadphonist.com) and [a blog about HTML and CSS](https://htmlycss.com).

Iâ€™m very interested in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, blogs, the open web and podcasting. When AFK I hang out with my kids, bake bread and cook yummy things.

Say hi! You can reach me at axel-at-paskola.com.
